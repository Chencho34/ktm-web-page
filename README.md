# KTM Web Page

## Project Create With HTML5 & CSS3 (BEM)

In this project, I make use of HTML5 technologies by applying solid semantics to provide a robust structure to the web page. In addition, I use CSS3 with the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology for stylization through classes, ensuring a visual design consistent and maintainable.

## Description

This project is based on the design concept inspired by the official KTM website, using HTML5 and CSS3 as main technologies. It presents a minimalist and modern interface. The page consists of a hero where a presentation is shown to the user and a gallery of minimalist cards that display the different motorcycles. Additionally, it includes a footer with relevant information and contact details.
